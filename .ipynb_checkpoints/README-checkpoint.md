# AMDS2025 Science Objective: Planetary Formation (Accretion)

## Objective

To determine whether peas-in-a-pod formation or hierarchical accretion is dominant around young (<1Gyr) Sun-like stars by testing for a significant (Bayes Factor threshold > 10) difference in the occurence rates of short period (<200 days) terrestrial (R<1.5 R_⊕) planets in systems with and without larger (R>1.5 R_⊕) gaseous planets on long period orbits (>200 days). 

## Theoretical Model

- **Peas-in-a-pod formation model:** core accretion with no runaway gas accretion.
- **Hierarchical accretion model:** core accretion with runaway gas accretion, planetary migration models.
- Kepler & TESS planet occurrence rates to inform where we do and don't see planets.
- Population synthesis models of planetary formation to determine what kinds of planets could exist where under a given set of conditions.
