# AMDS2025 Science Objective: Planetary Architecture
## Objective

To determine whether peas-in-a-pod formation or hierarchical accretion is dominant around young[^1] Sun-like stars by testing for a significant[^2] difference in the occurrence rates of short period[^3] terrestrial[^4] planets in systems with and without larger[^5] gaseous planets on long period orbits[^6]. 

[^1]: $<1\,Gyr$
[^2]: Bayes Factor threshold > 10
[^3]: $<200$ days
[^4]: $R<1.5R_\oplus$
[^5]: $R>1.5R_\oplus$
[^6]: $>200$ days

## Theoretical Model

- **Peas-in-a-pod formation model:** core accretion with no runaway gas accretion (<a href="#weiss2018">Weiss 2018</a>).
- **Hierarchical accretion model:** core accretion with runaway gas accretion, planetary migration models.
- Kepler & TESS planet occurrence rates to inform where we do and don't see planets.
- Population synthesis models of planetary formation to determine what kinds of planets could exist where under a given set of conditions.

## Physical Parameters

| Parameter | Minimum | Maximum | $\sigma$ |
|-----------|---------|---------|----------|
| Planet Radius| $1.5R_\oplus$ | $13R_\oplus$ | $0.1R_\oplus$ |
| Orbital Period | $200d$ | $5000d$ | $1d$ |
